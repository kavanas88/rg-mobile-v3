      <b>Terms of Service</b>
      <br>
      <b>Revision date October 27, 2016</b>
      <br>
      <br>

      <b>Effective date May 16, 2008</b>
      <br>
      <br> Welcome to RareShare.org ("RG Patient’s App")! We are built on a premise that sharing information is good, especially
      when it comes to information about rare diseases. The more you share the more you have an opportunity to help others
      whose lives have been touched by rare disease. Since rare diseases are not common, they are also often not well understood.
      By joining our community of support and sharing information about your experience, you will help others, including
      researchers, better understand your disease.
      <br>
      <br> Below are the Terms of Service, and in the right column, you will find a summary that will help you understand these
      terms, although the summary is not legally binding.
      <br>
      <br> The following terms constitute an agreement between you and Rare Genomics Institute, Inc. (“Rare Genomics” or “we”
      or “us”) the operator of RareShare. RareShare, described below, provides users with a wide array of services including,
      without limitation, news, reference resources, personalized content, and communication platforms (collectively, the
      "Services"). The Services are provided to users of RareShare subject to the following Terms of Service (the "Terms"),
      the most current version of which is located at the bottom of any page of RareShare. By using the Services, you the
      user (“user” or “you”) agree to these Terms, whether or not you are a registered member of RareShare or just a casual
      visitor. These Terms govern your use of the Services and create a binding legal agreement that we may enforce against
      you in the event of a violation. If you do not agree to all of these Terms of Service, do not use the Services. To
      the extent you register with RareShare as a member, then in addition to the terms that are applicable to all users
      of RareShare, the terms that apply only to members shall apply to you too as well.
      <br>
      <br>

      <b>Account Registration</b>
      <br>
      <br> You must register an account with RareShare to access all of the Services. Registration requires you to provide us
      with information about yourself, which include your name, birthdate, gender, picture, email address, profession, relationship
      to a rare disease patient, country, state, city, zip code, home community, a statement about yourself, your website
      URL, your blog URL, and other information specified in the registration form ("Registration Information"), and to select
      a username and password that will be associated with your account. You agree that your Registration Information is
      true, accurate, current, and complete, and you will promptly update your Registration Information as necessary so that
      it continues to be true, accurate, current and complete. We may attempt to verify the accuracy of the Registration
      Information that you have provided and update it as necessary. All members represent and warrant that the information
      they provided when registering as a member, and all information that they subsequently provide regarding themselves
      and their membership, is true and accurate and not misleading.
      <br>
      <br>

      <b>Protection and Use of Your Membership Password and Login</b>
      <br>
      <br> You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your RareShare account username and
      password and you may not permit another person to use your username and password to access the Services. You are solely
      responsible for the control of your account access information and all activity that occurs under your account. If
      you believe that the security of your account information has been compromised, you should immediately change your
      username and password through the account settings feature or notify us at info@rareshare.org and we will assist you.
      You grant Rare Genomics and all other persons or entities involved in the operation of RareShare the right to transmit,
      monitor, retrieve, store, and use your information in connection with the operation of RareShare. Rare Genomics cannot
      and does not assume any responsibility or liability for any information you submit, or your or third parties' use or
